    <p>You found the other page!</p>

    <h3>Did you see the URL and page title change aswell?</h3>
    <p>The application in DEV mode uses `#` in the URL to allow local SPA feeling without the need for a webserver.</p>

    <p>When the application is not running in DEV mode, the URLs are clean</p>
